# Introduction
 I think one of the best ways to understand myself is to understand what I find interesting. These assortment of topics give a glimpse into fields I either have knowledge in or just find fascinating.

# Social Media
  Social Media is something that has become so essential to our everyday lives, yet something that changes and adapts constantly. All it takes is one algorithm change to completely alter your information intake.  
  \
  It started with Facebook with my generation, and then Instagram, but has evolved into a plethora of apps that we all use for different reasons. No matter what becomes the next big digital town square or most efficient method to staying updated on friends and family, the center of all of these platforms are the humans longing for connection and information.  

# Blockchain

  Blockchain technology I think is such an enigma to 99% of people that most of what I could say would sound like nonsense. Also the concept of crypto has become so conflated with scams(unfortunate) and misfortune that your mind on this topic is already made up.  
  \
  Regardless of how you feel about this topic currently, one thing is certain and that is this technology will not be going away anytime soon, therefore it's in your best interest to continue learning about it.  
  \
 I think what is important are a few major concrete details. For starters technology such as Bitcoin that can act as a finite storage of value as well as a public ledger is something that is so unique to the human race we haven't really utilized it to it's full potential yet. Almost instantly transferring wealth between users anywhere in the world is something useful for modern countries, and transformative for poorer nations, nations that have never even experienced stable currencies nor bank account ownership.  
 \
 On top of this when you go deeper into the capabilities of smart contracts such as Ethereum, Zero Knowledge Proof technology (look that up), and other Layer 1 protocols, I really do think this is the next step of the internet.


# Artificial Intelligence

I think this particular thought will continue to change drastically overtime, as has the landscape of AI. As of right now beginning 2023 in general I believe AI will become so ingrained in our lives in the near future we will wonder how we ever lived without it.  
\
With so many applications it seems mundane tasks aka "busy work" will be able to be completed almost instantly. There is no telling to how productive we can become. This is coming from the optimist in me who wishes for good things to come out of artificial intelligence, yet understands the pessimistic ramifications of technology like this. Deep-fakes for instance are all to real and that is just the tip of the iceberg.
